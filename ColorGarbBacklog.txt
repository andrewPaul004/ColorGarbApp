Implement Email Service completely
Bulk Import Organizations
Ability for ColorGarb to create new users and send them a "join the app" email (one click from the app), and then have that user set up their account.
Ability for ColorGarb staff to see inbox of messages from all clients instead of having to go into the order to respond
For Clients
	Get rid of filtering on orders page
	Show active orders only
	Show past orders in a collapsed but expandable state
	Inactive/Completed orders are view only when pulling up their details (no new messages, no new attachments, no edits)

New Stage should look like TODOist radio buttons so user check off stages that are completed


Create New Order
	Drop Down of clients
	
	
Create Organizations
	Organization name
	Primary Email Address
	Shipping and billing address
	
	
Create New Order
	From Client - https://colorgarb.me/initial-info  (except name and email)
	    + When will you be able to provide your measurements
		+ Instead of When is your performance?  Ask when do you need these by
		+ Do you need a sample prior to production?
	From Admin 
		Order name (Fall 2025, Winter 2025, etc)
		# of performers
		Special Instructions
		Total Amount would be "Pending Design Approval"
		In Admin Portal, Add "Import Invoice" to Actions drop down, and when an invoice is imported, pull the total amount from the PDF and update order total amount accordingly, and change the order name to the name of the invoice.  Save the invoice to the order and it will show up in the documents section. Once an invoice has been uploaded, change "Import Invoice" to "Edit Invoice"
