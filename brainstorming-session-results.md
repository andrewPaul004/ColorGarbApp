# Brainstorming Session Results: ColorGarb Client Portal App

## Session Overview
**Date:** August 22, 2025  
**Objective:** Brainstorm features for a mobile and desktop app to provide clients with updates during costume production  
**Technology Stack:** React/TypeScript (Frontend), .NET (Backend)

## Core Business Problems Identified
- **Primary Pain Point:** Manually sending 100+ client emails about production updates
- **Client Anxiety:** Uncertainty around shipping dates and production status
- **Process Inefficiency:** No centralized place for clients to reference order status
- **Communication Overhead:** Constant "Where are we?" inquiries

## Initial Brainstorming Ideas (Explored)
### Auto-Detection Features
- Smart status detection from progress photos
- Two-stage triggers: "Start Cutting" and "Start Sewing"
- ML-based recognition of costume production phases

### Client Self-Service Portal
- Live timeline with progress bars
- Photo gallery of production stages
- Order details hub with specifications and delivery dates
- Communication history in chronological order

## Refined Solution: Comprehensive Business Management Platform

### Core Goals
1. **Reduce "Where are we?" emails**
2. **Collect requirements on time** (payments, POs, measurements, approvals)
3. **Maintain clean audit trail** for schools/boosters and internal team

### User Roles
- **Org Admin** (Band Director/Guard Director)
- **Finance/Booster** (PO upload, invoice payment)
- **Staff/Assistant** (measurements, counts entry)
- **ColorGarb Admin** (internal team)

### Key Features

#### 1. Order Workspace (Per Program/Season)
- **Progress Bar:** Inquiry → Design → Quote → Deposit → Measurements → Production → QC → Ship
- **Dual Ship Dates:** Original + Revised (with reason and change history)
- **Milestone Cards:** Owner, due date, attachments, comments, "what's next"

#### 2. Timeline & Notifications (Automated)
**Event-Driven Alerts (Email + SMS):**
- Deposit requested/received
- Measurements due/overdue
- Size confirmation needed
- PO uploaded/approved
- Production started/in QC/packed
- Ship date updated (with old→new date and reason)
- Shipped (with tracking)

**Time-Based Nudges:**
- "Measurements due in 7 days/48 hours/overdue"
- "Final payment due X days before ship date"
- "Address confirmation 5 days before ship"

#### 3. Payments, POs, and Invoices
- **Secure Payments:** Stripe/QuickBooks/PayPal integration
- **PO Management:** Upload validation, tie to invoices
- **Payment Rules:** "Require payment-in-full or approved PO before ship"
- **Auto-Splitting:** Deposit vs balance invoices
- **Downloadables:** Invoices, receipts, W-9, vendor forms

#### 4. Measurements & Sizing (Guard Logistics Focused)
**Bulk Intake Options:**
- Mobile-friendly web forms per performer
- CSV/Google Sheet import
- Shareable parent links (optional)

**Smart Validation:**
- Required fields: height, chest/bust, waist, hip, inseam, girth
- Range checks + outlier flagging
- Counts per variant with live tally
- Auto-sizing suggestions with manual override
- Lock & snapshot for production

#### 5. Design Proofs & Approvals
- **Proof Gallery:** Sketches, renderings, fabric swatches, print tests
- **Versioning:** Side-by-side compare with change log
- **E-Signature Approval:** Required checkboxes confirmation
- **Sample Handling:** Request toggle, tracking, feedback, production approval

#### 6. Shipping & Addresses
- **Address Book:** Per organization (school vs director's home)
- **Carrier Integration:** Live tracking, proof of delivery
- **Documentation:** Carton manifest/packing list downloads

#### 7. Messages & Audit Trail
- **Message Center:** Per order with attachments, @mentions, roles

- **Template Editor:** Email/SMS templates with variables
- **Integrations:** Stripe/QuickBooks, ShipStation/UPS/FedEx
- **Role Controls:** Permission-based access

### Data Model Structure
- **Organization:** Contacts, roles, addresses
- **Order:** Season, program, design package, milestones, ship dates
- **Line Items:** Style/variant, colorway, unit price, quantity
- **Performer:** Measurements and assigned size (optional)
- **Documents:** POs, invoices, proofs, approvals
- **Payments:** Status, method, receipts
- **Shipments:** Carrier, tracking, cartons, POD
- **Events:** Timeline changes, approvals, messages

## Implementation Roadmap

### MVP (Build First)
- Order workspace with progress bar
- Original vs Revised Ship Date (with reason + history)
- Measurements intake + size mapping + counts per variant
- Proof approvals with e-signature
- Payments & PO upload with shipping rules
- Basic notifications (measurements due, payment due, ship date updates, shipped)
- Shipping tracking + address confirmation
- Message center + audit log

### Phase 2
- Capacity planner with automated ship date pushes
- Template editor for notifications + no-code automation rules
- CSV/Sheets integration for measurements
- QR labels for cartons
- Director mobile view (quick approvals, scan-to-confirm)

### Phase 3 (Delight Features)
- In-portal mockup visualizer (colorway swaps)
- Inventory of standard fabrics/colors with lead-time estimator
- Performance analytics (on-time metrics, revision cycles)
- Parent/performer self-entry links

## UX Considerations
- **Mobile-First:** Directors work in gyms/fields
- **Clear Status:** "What's blocking shipment?" ribbon for holds
- **Action-Oriented:** "Next action" pill at top of each order
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, dark mode
- **Download Center:** One-tap access to all documents

## Compliance & Privacy
- **Minimal Student Data:** Store only what's needed (names optional)
- **Role-Limited Access:** Audit logs for compliance
- **Data Retention:** Clear policy with secure file storage

## Key Insight
The solution evolved from simple costume progress tracking to a comprehensive business management platform that addresses the real operational challenges of managing 100+ school/organization clients with complex approval workflows, payment requirements, and compliance needs.
