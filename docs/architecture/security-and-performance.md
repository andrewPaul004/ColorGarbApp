# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

**Frontend Security:**
- CSP Headers: `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://js.stripe.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com; img-src 'self' data: https:; connect-src 'self' https://api.colorgarb.com https://api.stripe.com`
- XSS Prevention: React built-in protection, input sanitization, Content Security Policy enforcement
- Secure Storage: JWT tokens in httpOnly cookies, sensitive data encrypted in localStorage with Web Crypto API

**Backend Security:**
- Input Validation: FluentValidation for all API inputs, SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries
- Rate Limiting: 100 requests per minute per user, 1000 requests per minute per organization
- CORS Policy: Restricted to known frontend domains (portal.colorgarb.com, staging.colorgarb.com)

**Authentication Security:**
- Token Storage: JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration, refresh tokens with 30-day expiration
- Session Management: Redis-based session storage with automatic cleanup
- Password Policy: Minimum 8 characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols required

## Performance Optimization

**Frontend Performance:**
- Bundle Size Target: < 500KB initial bundle, < 1MB total with lazy loading
- Loading Strategy: Route-based code splitting, component lazy loading, image optimization
- Caching Strategy: Service Worker for offline capability, CDN caching for static assets

**Backend Performance:**
- Response Time Target: < 200ms for dashboard queries, < 500ms for complex operations
- Database Optimization: Query optimization, proper indexing, connection pooling
- Caching Strategy: Redis for session data, query result caching, distributed cache for multi-instance deployment
