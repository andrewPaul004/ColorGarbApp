### Overall UX Goals & Principles

#### Target User Personas

**Band Director:** Music education professionals managing 50-200+ performer costume orders. They work primarily from mobile devices in field environments (rehearsal halls, stadiums) and need quick access to order status, deadlines, and communication tools. High stress about delivery timing for performance dates.

**Finance User:** School/booster organization financial administrators who handle purchase orders, payment approvals, and budget compliance. They need clear audit trails, approval workflows, and integration with existing financial processes.

**ColorGarb Staff:** Customer service and production staff who manage multiple client orders simultaneously. They need administrative oversight, communication tools, and the ability to update order progress efficiently across all client organizations.

#### Usability Goals

- **Immediate Orientation:** New users can understand their order status and next required actions within 30 seconds of login
- **Mobile Efficiency:** Band directors can complete critical tasks (check status, approve proofs, submit measurements) in under 2 minutes on mobile devices
- **Communication Clarity:** 90% reduction in "when will my order ship?" inquiries through transparent timeline visibility
- **Error Prevention:** Validation and confirmation workflows prevent costly measurement errors and payment processing issues
- **Stress Reduction:** Clear deadline tracking and proactive notifications eliminate anxiety about performance date delivery

**Layout Changes:** Single column mobile layout expanding to multi-column layouts on larger screens. Timeline component transitions from horizontal scroll (mobile) to vertical display (desktop).

**Navigation Changes:** Bottom tab navigation on mobile transforms to horizontal navigation bar on desktop. Hamburger menu for secondary navigation items on mobile.

**Content Priority:** Progressive disclosure hides less critical information on mobile with expand/collapse patterns. Dashboard shows more order details on larger screens.

**Interaction Changes:** Touch-optimized interactions on mobile (swipe, tap, long-press) with mouse hover states and keyboard shortcuts on desktop.

## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Motion Principles
Subtle, purposeful animations that enhance usability without distraction. Focus on providing feedback for user actions, indicating loading states, and guiding attention to important changes. All animations respect user's reduced motion preferences.

### Key Animations
- **Timeline Progress:** Smooth progress indicator animation when stages update (Duration: 300ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Card Interactions:** Subtle hover and tap feedback for order cards (Duration: 150ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Loading States:** Skeleton loading for content areas and spinner for actions (Duration: Continuous, Easing: linear)
- **Notification Slide:** Notification messages slide in from top with gentle bounce (Duration: 400ms, Easing: ease-back)
- **Form Validation:** Error state transitions with color and icon changes (Duration: 200ms, Easing: ease-out)

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals
- **Page Load:** Under 2 seconds for dashboard on 3G connection
- **Interaction Response:** Under 100ms response time for all user interactions
- **Animation FPS:** Maintain 60fps for all animations and scrolling

### Design Strategies
Optimize image assets with WebP format and responsive image loading. Implement skeleton loading patterns to provide immediate visual feedback. Use progressive enhancement for non-critical features. Minimize animation complexity and respect user's reduced motion preferences.
