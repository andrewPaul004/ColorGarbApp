# Animation & Micro-interactions

## Motion Principles
Subtle, purposeful animations that enhance usability without distraction. Focus on providing feedback for user actions, indicating loading states, and guiding attention to important changes. All animations respect user's reduced motion preferences.

## Key Animations
