# Performance Considerations

## Performance Goals
- **Page Load:** Under 2 seconds for dashboard on 3G connection
- **Interaction Response:** Under 100ms response time for all user interactions
- **Animation FPS:** Maintain 60fps for all animations and scrolling

## Design Strategies
Optimize image assets with WebP format and responsive image loading. Implement skeleton loading patterns to provide immediate visual feedback. Use progressive enhancement for non-critical features. Minimize animation complexity and respect user's reduced motion preferences.
