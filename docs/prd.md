# ColorGarb Client Portal Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
• Reduce client communication overhead by 75% (from 15-20 hours to 4-5 hours per week)
• Achieve 90%+ client satisfaction through transparent order tracking and automated notifications
• Enable 50% client base expansion without proportional communication overhead increase
• Establish technology leadership position in costume industry within 12 months
• Eliminate manual email coordination for measurements, approvals, and payment processes
• Provide real-time order visibility to reduce client anxiety about delivery timing
• Create mobile-first solution optimized for band directors' field-based work environments

### Background Context

ColorGarb currently faces significant operational inefficiencies managing 100+ individual client emails for order updates, while clients experience anxiety and uncertainty due to lack of transparent order visibility. The custom costume manufacturing industry represents a blue ocean opportunity where traditional companies rely on manual communication methods and generic project management tools lack industry specialization.

The proposed client portal will transform ColorGarb from a traditional costume manufacturer into a technology-enabled industry leader by combining deep industry expertise with modern SaaS principles. This specialized platform addresses unique costume industry workflows (dual ship date tracking, measurement collection, PO processing) while maintaining the personal service quality that differentiates ColorGarb in the market.
