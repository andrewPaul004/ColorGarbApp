# Epic 1: Foundation & Authentication Infrastructure

**Epic Goal:** Establish the foundational infrastructure for the ColorGarb Client Portal including user authentication, role-based access control, and the basic portal framework that enables secure client access to their order information.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup and Development Environment

As a **developer**,
I want **a fully configured development environment with React/TypeScript frontend and .NET Core backend**,
so that **I can begin building the client portal with proper tooling and deployment pipeline**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. React application created with TypeScript configuration and responsive CSS framework
2. .NET Core Web API project configured with proper folder structure
3. Database connection configured for SQL Server or PostgreSQL
4. Redis caching layer configured and tested
5. Development environment supports hot reloading for both frontend and backend
6. Initial CI/CD pipeline configured for automated testing and deployment
7. Version control repository structure established with frontend/backend separation

## Story 1.2: User Authentication System

As a **band director or organization administrator**,
I want **to securely log into the client portal using my credentials**,
so that **I can access my organization's order information safely**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Login page with email/password authentication implemented
2. Password reset functionality via email link
3. Session management with secure token-based authentication
4. Account lockout protection after failed login attempts
5. HTTPS enforcement for all authentication endpoints
6. Mobile-responsive login interface
7. Error handling for invalid credentials with appropriate user feedback

## Story 1.3: Role-Based Access Control

As a **system administrator**,
I want **different user roles with appropriate permissions (Director, Finance, ColorGarb Staff)**,
so that **users can only access information and actions appropriate to their role**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. User role assignment system (Director, Finance User, ColorGarb Staff)
2. Permission-based route protection in frontend application
3. API endpoint authorization based on user roles
4. Role-specific navigation menus and available actions
5. Audit logging for role-based access attempts
6. Admin interface for managing user roles and permissions
7. Default role assignment workflow for new user registration

## Story 1.4: Basic Client Portal Framework

As a **client user**,
I want **a main dashboard that shows only my organization's active orders**,
so that **I can quickly see the status of all my orders in one place without seeing other customers' information**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Main dashboard displaying list of active orders filtered strictly by user's organization
2. Organization-based data isolation ensuring no cross-customer data visibility
3. Basic order information shown (order number, description, current stage)
4. Responsive navigation menu with role-appropriate options
5. User profile section with basic account information and organization details
6. Logout functionality with session cleanup
7. Basic styling consistent with ColorGarb branding
8. Mobile-optimized layout for dashboard and navigation
