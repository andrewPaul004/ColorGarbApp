## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] All existing APIs remain unchanged - new endpoints only
- [ ] Database schema changes are purely additive with backward compatibility
- [ ] UI changes follow existing Material-UI patterns and responsive design
- [ ] Authentication and authorization systems extended, not modified
- [ ] Performance impact minimized through efficient queries and caching
- [ ] Existing notification system enhanced, not replaced
- [ ] Current user workflows remain functional during and after implementation

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** Complex scope expansion affecting system stability and user workflows
**Mitigation:** Phased rollout with feature flags, comprehensive regression testing, staged user group releases
**Rollback Plan:** Feature flags allow instant disabling of new features, database migrations designed for safe rollback

**Secondary Risk:** User adoption challenges with workflow changes
**Mitigation:** User training materials, optional adoption (existing workflows remain), feedback collection system
**Rollback Plan:** Configurable UI allowing users to opt back to previous interfaces
