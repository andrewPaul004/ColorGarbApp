# Epic 9A: Critical Business Features - Immediate Implementation

**Epic Goal:** Address critical operational gaps and system bugs that block core business workflows, ensuring ColorGarb can operate efficiently with essential order creation and functional admin tools.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- **Current functionality:** Functional client portal with authentication, order management, and basic communication systems (Epics 1-3 implemented)
- **Technology stack:** React/TypeScript frontend with Material-UI, .NET Core Web API backend, Azure SQL Database, role-based authorization
- **Integration points:** Order management system, user authentication/authorization, message center

**Critical Gaps Identified:**

- **Missing Core Business Function:** No way to create new orders in the system - blocking primary business operations
- **Broken Admin Tools:** Status filtering non-functional, impacting daily operations
- **Mobile Experience Broken:** Three-dot actions don't work, affecting mobile users
- **Impact:** These issues prevent normal business operations and must be resolved immediately

## Story 9A.1: Admin Status Filter Bug Fix

As a **ColorGarb admin**,  
I want **the status filter on the admin orders page to work correctly**,  
so that **I can efficiently filter orders by their current status for daily operations**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Status filter dropdown displays all available order status options correctly
2. Selecting a status filters the order list to show only orders with that status
3. Filter persists during session until manually changed or cleared
4. "All Statuses" option shows complete order list
5. Filter state management works correctly in component state
6. Filter application completes within 2 seconds
7. No performance degradation compared to unfiltered view
8. Graceful handling of API errors during filtering
9. Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
10. No regression in other admin functionality

## Story 9A.2: Mobile Action Menu Bug Fix

As a **mobile user (Director, Finance, or Admin)**,  
I want **the three-dot action menu to work correctly on mobile devices**,  
so that **I can access order actions and functionality while away from my desktop**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Three-dot icon is clearly visible and appropriately sized for touch interaction (â‰¥44px)
2. Tapping three-dot icon opens action menu reliably on mobile devices
3. Menu positioning prevents cutoff at screen edges on various screen sizes
4. All action items displayed correctly in mobile menu format
5. Each menu item responds to tap gestures and executes correct functionality
6. Menu dismisses appropriately when action is selected or user taps outside
7. Works on iOS Safari (iPhone/iPad) and Android Chrome consistently
8. Menu appears with smooth animation/transition (<300ms)
9. No impact on desktop three-dot menu functionality (regression prevention)
10. Accessibility standards maintained (screen reader compatibility, focus management)

## Story 9A.3: Create New Order - Director & Finance Users

As a **band director or finance user**,
I want **to create new orders directly in the portal using a streamlined form**,
so that **I can initiate orders efficiently without external processes or manual intervention**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Order creation form accessible from main dashboard for Director/Finance roles only
2. Form fields based on existing colorgarb.me/initial-info pattern (excluding name/email - auto-populated from user account)
3. Required field: "When will you provide measurements?" with date picker validation
4. Modified field: "When do you need these by?" (replaces performance date concept)
5. Optional field: "Do you need a sample prior to production?" (yes/no selection)
6. Complete form validation with clear, specific error messaging for each field
7. Order automatically associated with authenticated user's organization (no selection needed)
8. Order creation triggers immediate email notification to ColorGarb staff with order details
9. Confirmation screen displays order details, assigned order number, and clear next steps
10. Mobile-responsive form layout following existing Material-UI design patterns

## Story 9A.4: Create New Order - ColorGarb Admin

As a **ColorGarb admin**,
I want **enhanced order creation capabilities with full administrative controls**,
so that **I can efficiently manage orders for any organization with complete customization options**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Admin order creation form accessible from admin interface with organization selection dropdown
2. Admin-specific fields: Order name (e.g., "Fall 2025", "Winter 2025"), Number of performers, Special Instructions (multi-line text)
3. Default total amount displays as "Pending Design Approval" with ability to edit
4. "Import Invoice" action in order actions dropdown - uploads PDF and extracts total amount automatically
5. Invoice import functionality updates order name to match invoice name and saves PDF to order documents section
6. After successful invoice upload, "Import Invoice" action changes to "Edit Invoice" in dropdown
7. Admin can select which order stages apply during creation (configurable stage selection)
8. Order creation includes complete audit trail logging (admin name, timestamp, organization assigned)
9. Bulk order creation capability for creating multiple similar orders efficiently
10. Integration with existing admin notification systems and user management

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] All existing APIs remain unchanged - new endpoints follow established patterns
- [ ] Database schema changes are purely additive with full backward compatibility
- [ ] UI changes follow existing Material-UI patterns and responsive design standards
- [ ] Authentication and authorization systems extended appropriately, not modified
- [ ] Performance impact minimized through efficient queries and proper indexing
- [ ] All existing user workflows remain fully functional during and after implementation

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** Critical business operations currently blocked by missing functionality
**Mitigation:** Prioritize order creation features immediately, implement with feature flags for safe deployment
**Rollback Plan:** Feature flags allow instant disabling, database changes designed for safe rollback

**Secondary Risk:** Bug fixes introduce regressions in working functionality  
**Mitigation:** Comprehensive regression testing, staged deployment, thorough testing on multiple devices/browsers
**Rollback Plan:** Git-based rollback for code changes, monitoring alerts for immediate issue detection

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria fully met and verified
- [ ] Critical business workflow (order creation) fully operational for all user types
- [ ] Admin tools function correctly without performance degradation
- [ ] Mobile experience restored to full functionality across target devices
- [ ] Zero regressions introduced to existing Epic 1-3 functionality
- [ ] Performance benchmarks maintained (<2s response times, <300ms UI interactions)
- [ ] Cross-browser and mobile device testing completed successfully
- [ ] Security review completed for new order creation endpoints
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed by real stakeholders
- [ ] Production deployment completed with monitoring and rollback capability
