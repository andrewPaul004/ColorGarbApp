# Epic 9B: Workflow Enhancements - Post-MVP Implementation

**Epic Goal:** Enhance ColorGarbApp with workflow optimizations and user experience improvements that increase operational efficiency and user satisfaction, building upon the critical functionality delivered in Epic 9A.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- **Prerequisites:** Epic 9A completed successfully (critical business functions operational)
- **Current functionality:** Full client portal with working order creation, admin tools, and mobile experience
- **Technology stack:** React/TypeScript frontend with Material-UI, .NET Core Web API backend, Azure SQL Database
- **Integration points:** Order management system, user authentication/authorization, message center, notification system

**Enhancement Details:**

- **What's being added:** Workflow efficiency improvements, user experience enhancements, administrative productivity tools
- **How it integrates:** Extends existing components while maintaining full backward compatibility
- **Success criteria:** Improved user satisfaction, increased administrative efficiency, streamlined workflows

**Deferral Rationale:** These features enhance the user experience but are not critical for core business operations. They can be implemented after MVP to ensure system stability and allow for user feedback incorporation.

## Story 9B.1: Admin Message Inbox

7. Message priority indicators for urgent communications based on configurable criteria
8. Bulk actions for marking multiple messages as read/unread efficiently
9. Integration maintains full conversation history in existing message center
10. Real-time updates when new messages arrive (WebSocket or polling implementation)

## Story 9B.2: Order List UX Enhancement

As a **director or finance user**,
I want **simplified order views focused on active orders with easy access to completed orders**,
so that **I can focus on current work while still accessing historical information when needed**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Remove all filtering controls from main order list view (simplified interface)
2. Display active orders prominently by default with full card visibility
3. Completed/inactive orders in collapsed, expandable section below active orders ("Show Completed Orders" toggle)
4. Clear visual distinction between active and completed order cards (color, opacity, icons)
5. Completed orders marked as view-only mode (no message, attachment, or edit capabilities)
6. "View Details" mode for completed orders showing full order history and timeline
7. Quick action buttons visible on active orders only (message, upload, view details)
8. Smooth loading states and transitions between expanded/collapsed views
9. Mobile-optimized layout maintaining same functionality and visual hierarchy
10. Preserve existing order card information architecture and data display

## Story 9B.3: Todoist-Style Stage Management

As a **ColorGarb admin**,
I want **checkbox-style stage management similar to Todoist**,
so that **I can efficiently track and update order progress with intuitive interactions**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Order stages displayed as interactive checkboxes instead of current timeline format
2. Click checkbox to mark stage as complete with immediate visual feedback and state update
3. Completed stages show checkmark icon with timestamp and admin name who completed it
4. Ability to uncheck completed stages if work needs revision (with confirmation dialog)
5. Stage completion triggers existing notification system for client updates automatically
6. Visual progress indicator showing percentage completion based on completed stages
7. Hover states and informative tooltips for stage descriptions and requirements
8. Keyboard navigation support for accessibility (space to toggle, arrow keys to navigate)
9. Mobile-friendly checkbox sizing (â‰¥44px touch targets) and interaction patterns
10. Full integration with existing stage management business logic and audit trails

## Story 9B.4: Organization Management

As a **ColorGarb admin**,
I want **comprehensive organization management capabilities**,
so that **I can efficiently create and maintain client organization records with complete information**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Organization management section accessible from main admin interface navigation
2. Create new organization form with required fields: Organization name, Primary email address (validated), complete billing address
3. Shipping address section with "Same as billing address" checkbox option for efficiency
4. Organization list view with search functionality and filter capabilities (active, inactive, region)
5. Edit existing organization details with complete audit trail of all changes
6. View organization order history, statistics, and relationship insights
7. Bulk import capability for multiple organizations via CSV upload with validation
8. Organization deactivation (soft delete) to preserve historical data and relationships
9. Integration with existing user role assignment system and permission management
10. Export organization data functionality for reporting and analysis purposes

## Story 9B.5: Advanced Stage Configuration

As a **ColorGarb admin**,
I want **system-level stage management configuration capabilities**,
so that **I can customize order workflows for different order types and evolving business needs**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. System Settings section with dedicated stage management configuration interface
2. Create, edit, and delete custom stage templates with drag-and-drop ordering
3. Define stage dependencies and conditional requirements based on order characteristics
4. Set which stages are required vs. optional for different order types or organizations
5. Configure stage-specific notification triggers and recipient rules
6. Template library for common workflow patterns (standard, rush, custom, etc.)
7. Assign default stage templates to specific organization types or order categories
8. Version control system for stage template changes with rollback capability
9. Bulk apply new stage configurations to existing orders (with admin confirmation)
10. Stage usage analytics and reporting for workflow optimization insights
