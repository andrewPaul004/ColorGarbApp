# UI Integration Smoke Test Checklist

## Purpose
This checklist verifies that UI components are properly integrated into the application and accessible through normal user navigation flows. Use this **before** executing detailed test plans to ensure features are actually accessible.

## Instructions
- ‚úÖ Mark items as complete when verified
- ‚ùå Mark items as failed with notes
- üö´ Mark items as blocked if feature is not accessible

## General Integration Verification

### Component Loading
- [ ] No React component import errors in browser console
- [ ] No missing dependency errors
- [ ] All UI elements render without layout issues

### Navigation Flow
- [ ] All features accessible via documented navigation paths
- [ ] No broken links or 404 errors
- [ ] Back button works properly from all feature pages

### Responsive Design
- [ ] All components display properly on mobile devices
- [ ] Material-UI Grid layouts work correctly
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling issues

## Pre-Test Environment Verification

Before executing detailed test plans, verify:

1. **Application Starts**: `npm run dev` starts without errors
2. **Login Works**: Can authenticate with test credentials
3. **Dashboard Loads**: Main dashboard accessible after login
4. **Core Navigation**: Profile, Orders, and Admin sections accessible

## Failed Integration Recovery

If components fail integration verification:

1. **Check Import Statements**: Verify components are imported where needed
2. **Check Route Configuration**: Ensure routes are added to App.tsx
3. **Check Component Integration**: Verify components are rendered in target pages
4. **Check Props**: Ensure required props are passed correctly
5. **Check Console Errors**: Review browser console for import/runtime errors

## Escalation Criteria

**Block Testing** if:
- ‚ùå Core navigation paths are broken
- ‚ùå Major components missing from target pages
- ‚ùå Application fails to start or authenticate

**Proceed with Caution** if:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor UI layout issues present
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some features inaccessible but workarounds exist
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Non-critical console warnings present
