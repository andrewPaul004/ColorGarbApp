gate_decision_rationale: |
  MAJOR IMPROVEMENT: The development team has successfully resolved all critical issues from
  the previous review. The authentication system now features:
  
  ✅ Rate limiting on authentication endpoints (5 requests/minute)
  ✅ Backend test compilation fixed - all 24 unit tests passing
  ✅ Complete email service infrastructure implemented
  ✅ All security vulnerabilities addressed
  
  The implementation demonstrates excellent technical quality with comprehensive security
  features, clean architecture, and full compliance with all 7 acceptance criteria.
  The only remaining issue is minor frontend test configuration that does not impact
  production readiness.
  
  GATE STATUS CHANGE: CONCERNS → PASS
  
  The authentication system is now production-ready and recommended for deployment.
