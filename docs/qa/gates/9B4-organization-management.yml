  security:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'Role-based authorization properly implemented but CSV imports and bulk operations present potential DoS vectors. Missing virus scanning and rate limiting.'
  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'CSV export loads all data into memory. No caching strategy. Order statistics queries may cause N+1 performance issues with large datasets.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent error handling, proper HTTP status codes, transaction handling via EF, graceful UI degradation.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Outstanding code quality with comprehensive JSDoc documentation, clean separation of concerns, consistent patterns, and TypeScript type safety.'
