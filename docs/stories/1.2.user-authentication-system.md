## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Key learnings from Story 1.1:
- Project structure is established with monorepo using apps/web (frontend) and apps/api (backend)
- JWT authentication middleware is already configured in .NET Core
- Azure AD B2C is planned for enterprise integration but basic email/password auth needed first
- Redis session storage is available for caching authentication data

### Data Models
From `docs/architecture/data-models.md`:
- **User Entity**: 
  - Id (Guid), Email (string), PasswordHash (string), FirstName (string), LastName (string)
  - Role (enum: Director, Finance, ColorGarbStaff), OrganizationId (Guid), IsActive (bool)
  - LastLoginAt (DateTime), CreatedAt (DateTime), UpdatedAt (DateTime)
- **Organization Entity**: Referenced via OrganizationId for data isolation
- **TypeScript Interface**: User interface available in packages/shared/src/types/

### API Specifications
From `docs/architecture/api-specification.md`:
- **POST /auth/login endpoint**: 
  - Request: `{ email: string, password: string }`
  - Response: `{ token: string, expiresIn: number, user: User }`
  - Security: No auth required for login endpoint, all others require Bearer token
- **Authentication Header**: `Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>`
- **Error Responses**: Standardized error format with proper HTTP status codes

### Frontend Architecture Details
From `docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md`:
- **Authentication State Management**: Zustand store with auth slice
  - Properties: user, token, isAuthenticated, login(), logout()
  - Token storage in localStorage with automatic API client integration
- **Protected Route Pattern**: ProtectedRoute component with role-based access
- **API Client Setup**: Axios interceptors for automatic token attachment and 401 handling
- **Component Location**: Auth pages in apps/web/src/pages/Auth/

### Backend Authentication Architecture
From `docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md`:
- **JWT Configuration**: Token-based authentication with user claims
- **Claims Structure**: User ID, Email, Role, OrganizationId for row-level security
- **Middleware**: OrganizationIsolationMiddleware for setting session context
- **Authorization**: Role-based authorization attributes and handlers
- **Password Security**: BCrypt hashing for password storage

### Database Schema Requirements
From `docs/architecture/database-schema.md`:
- **Users Table**: Email (unique), PasswordHash, Role, OrganizationId (FK)
- **Row-Level Security**: Enabled for organization data isolation
- **Session Context**: OrganizationId and UserRole set via sp_set_session_context
- **Indexes**: IX_Users_Email for login performance

### File Locations and Naming Conventions

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-22

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The user authentication system implementation demonstrates solid architectural design with comprehensive security features. The solution properly implements JWT-based authentication, BCrypt password hashing, account lockout protection, and follows established security patterns. The frontend provides excellent user experience with responsive design and proper error handling. All acceptance criteria have been implemented with appropriate technical depth.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed during this review. The code quality is already high with good separation of concerns, proper error handling, and adherence to coding standards.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Excellent JSDoc documentation, proper naming conventions, and type safety
- Project Structure: ✓ Files properly organized according to unified project structure 
- Testing Strategy: ✗ **Critical Issue:** Test project compilation errors prevent test execution
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 7 acceptance criteria have been implemented and validated

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Comprehensive JWT authentication system implemented (AuthController.cs)
- [x] Secure BCrypt password hashing with 12 salt rounds (AuthController.cs:315)
- [x] Account lockout mechanism after 5 failed attempts (AuthController.cs:323-335)
- [x] Mobile-responsive Material-UI login form (LoginPage.tsx)
- [x] Password reset flow with secure token generation (AuthController.cs:165-197)
- [x] Session management with Zustand store integration (authService.ts)
- [x] HTTPS enforcement configured in authentication middleware
- [ ] **Critical:** Fix test project compilation errors to enable test execution
- [ ] **High:** Add rate limiting middleware to authentication endpoints
- [ ] **Medium:** Implement actual email delivery for password reset functionality
- [ ] **Medium:** Add token refresh automation before expiry
- [ ] **Low:** Consider adding password strength validation on frontend

### Security Review

**Strengths:**
- BCrypt password hashing with secure 12-round salt implementation
- JWT tokens with appropriate expiration (1 hour)
- Account lockout protection prevents brute force attacks
- Organization-level data isolation through JWT claims
- Protection against email enumeration in forgot password flow
- Secure token generation for password reset functionality
- Proper input validation on both frontend and backend

**Areas for Enhancement:**
- **Missing rate limiting** on authentication endpoints could allow sophisticated attacks
- **HTTPS enforcement** is configured but needs verification in production deployment
- **Password reset email delivery** is stubbed out (marked as TODO)

### Performance Considerations

- Database queries are optimized with proper indexing on email field
- Login attempt cleanup runs periodically (5% probability) to prevent table bloat  
- JWT token verification is stateless and performant
- Frontend form validation prevents unnecessary API calls

### Files Modified During Review

None - no files were modified during this review. All identified issues can be addressed by the development team.

### Gate Status

Gate: **CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/1.2-user-authentication-system.yml

**Primary Issues:**
1. Test project compilation errors prevent verification of test suite
2. Missing rate limiting on authentication endpoints presents security risk
3. Password reset email delivery not implemented (production-blocking)

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above**

The story demonstrates excellent technical implementation but requires resolution of test compilation issues and security enhancements before production deployment. The core authentication functionality is solid and meets all acceptance criteria.
