## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Story 2.1 created the OrderDetail workspace with OrderHeader, OrderSummary, ContactInfo, QuickActions, and Breadcrumbs components. The timeline component will be integrated into this existing order workspace structure.

### Data Models and Types
**Order Stage Enumeration:** Use the 13-stage OrderStage type from shared types [Source: architecture/data-models.md#L119]
```typescript
type OrderStage = 
  | 'DesignProposal' | 'ProofApproval' | 'Measurements' | 'ProductionPlanning'
  | 'Cutting' | 'Sewing' | 'QualityControl' | 'Finishing'
  | 'FinalInspection' | 'Packaging' | 'ShippingPreparation' | 'ShipOrder'
  | 'Delivery';
```

**Order Interface:** Current order structure includes currentStage and timeline tracking [Source: architecture/data-models.md#L105]
```typescript
interface Order {
  id: string;
  orderNumber: string;
  organizationId: string;
  currentStage: OrderStage;
  originalShipDate: Date;
  currentShipDate: Date;
  // ... other fields
}
```

**Stage History Tracking:** For completed stages with timestamps [Source: architecture/data-models.md#L137]
- Orders have many OrderStageHistories for timeline tracking
- Each stage entry includes: stage, enteredAt, updatedBy, notes

```typescript
interface StageHistory {
  id: string;
  stage: OrderStage;
  enteredAt: Date;
  updatedBy: string;
  notes?: string;
}
```

### Component Architecture
**Component Organization:** Place timeline components in dedicated folder [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#L18]
- Location: `apps/web/src/components/timeline/OrderTimeline.tsx`
- Follow existing component patterns from OrderDetail components

**Component Props Pattern:** Follow established prop interface pattern [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#L30]
```typescript
interface OrderTimelineProps {
  orderId: string;
  currentStage: OrderStage;
  stageHistory: StageHistory[];
  onStageClick?: (stage: OrderStage) => void;
}
```

**MUI Integration:** Use Material-UI components consistently [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#L9]
- Import Box, Typography from '@mui/material'
- Use MUI theming and responsive breakpoints
- WCAG AA compliance built-in with MUI components

### Visual Design Specifications
**Stage State Indicators:** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#L9 - MUI theming]
- **Completed stages**: 
  - Color: `theme.palette.success.main` (green)
  - Icon: CheckCircle from '@mui/icons-material'
  - Background: `theme.palette.success.light` with 10% opacity
- **Current stage**: 
  - Color: `theme.palette.primary.main` (brand primary)
  - Icon: RadioButtonChecked from '@mui/icons-material' 
  - Background: `theme.palette.primary.light` with 15% opacity
  - Border: 2px solid `theme.palette.primary.main`
- **Future stages**: 
  - Color: `theme.palette.grey[400]`
  - Icon: RadioButtonUnchecked from '@mui/icons-material'
  - Background: `theme.palette.grey[50]`

**Timeline Layout Specifications:**
- Stage spacing: 16px vertical gap between stages (theme.spacing(2))
- Touch targets: Minimum 44px height for mobile accessibility
- Typography: 
  - Stage names: `variant="body1"` with `fontWeight="medium"`
  - Timestamps: `variant="body2"` with `color="text.secondary"`
  - Notes: `variant="caption"` when expanded

### State Management
**Zustand Store Integration:** Access order data from existing store [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#L82]
- Use existing orders state slice
- selectedOrder contains OrderDetail with stage history
- No specific guidance found in architecture docs for timeline-specific state

**Mobile-First Responsive Design:** Use Tailwind CSS utility classes [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#L27]
- Mobile-first approach with responsive breakpoints
- Touch-friendly interaction targets (minimum 44px)

### File Locations
**Component Files:** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#L18]
- Main component: `apps/web/src/components/timeline/OrderTimeline.tsx`
- Optional sub-components: `apps/web/src/components/timeline/TimelineStage.tsx`

**Test Files:** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#L19]
- Test location: `apps/web/tests/components/OrderTimeline.test.tsx`
- Follow existing test patterns from architecture

**Integration Location:** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#L21]
- Import into: `apps/web/src/pages/OrderDetail/OrderDetail.tsx`
- Add to existing order workspace layout

### Technical Constraints
**TypeScript Compliance:** All components must have full TypeScript interfaces [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#L7]
- Type-safe frontend development required
- No runtime type errors allowed

**JSDoc Documentation Required:** All public functions and interfaces [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#L6]
- Include @param, @returns, @example tags
- Component documentation with usage examples

### Testing
**Component Testing Requirements:** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#L19]
- Test file location: `apps/web/tests/components/OrderTimeline.test.tsx`
- Use Jest + React Testing Library
- Test all 13 stages rendering correctly
- Test stage status indicators (completed/current/pending)
- Test click functionality and callbacks
- Test mobile responsiveness
- Follow existing test patterns from OrderTimeline.test.tsx example [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#L92]

**Testing Framework:** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#L18]
- Jest + React Testing Library for component testing
- Include accessibility testing capabilities

### Project Structure Notes
No conflicts identified between story requirements and project structure. Timeline components align with defined folder structure and existing OrderDetail workspace architecture.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-24

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Excellent implementation quality** with comprehensive attention to detail. The OrderTimeline component demonstrates professional-grade development with:
- Complete TypeScript interfaces with JSDoc documentation
- Proper MUI integration following design system principles  
- Comprehensive test coverage including edge cases and accessibility
- Clean, maintainable component architecture
- Mobile-responsive design with accessibility considerations

### Refactoring Performed

Successfully resolved critical type duplication and architectural inconsistencies:

- **File**: packages/shared/src/types/order.ts
  - **Change**: Created centralized order type definitions
  - **Why**: Eliminated duplicate OrderStage and StageHistory interfaces across components
  - **How**: Consolidates types in shared package preventing maintenance drift and inconsistencies

- **File**: apps/web/src/components/timeline/OrderTimeline.tsx  
  - **Change**: Updated imports to use shared types
  - **Why**: Removes code duplication and ensures type consistency
  - **How**: Import from `@colorgarb/shared/types/order` instead of local definitions

- **File**: apps/web/src/pages/OrderDetail/OrderDetail.tsx
  - **Change**: Updated imports to use shared types and proper Order interface
  - **Why**: Consistency with shared type definitions and better type safety
  - **How**: Uses Order interface for mockOrder instead of ad-hoc typing

- **File**: apps/web/tests/components/OrderTimeline.test.tsx
  - **Change**: Updated test types to use shared StageHistory interface
  - **Why**: Ensures test types match actual implementation types
  - **How**: Import StageHistory from shared types instead of inline definitions

- **File**: packages/shared/src/types/index.ts
  - **Change**: Resolved conflicting OrderStage definitions
  - **Why**: Two different 13-stage enums existed causing type conflicts
  - **How**: Commented out old definitions and added exports for new order types

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Excellent JSDoc documentation, proper TypeScript usage, follows coding standards
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Components in correct locations, proper test placement, follows unified structure  
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Comprehensive component tests, proper test framework usage, accessibility testing
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ All 7 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested
