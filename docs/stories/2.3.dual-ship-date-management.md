## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Story 2.2 successfully created the OrderTimeline component and established the order workspace architecture in the OrderDetail page. The ship date component will integrate into this existing structure, sharing the same design patterns and state management approach.

### Data Models and Types
**Ship Date Tracking:** Use OrderStageHistory for ship date change tracking [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#L49]
```typescript
interface StageHistory {
  id: string;
  orderId: string;
  stage: OrderStage;
  enteredAt: Date;
  updatedBy: string;
  notes?: string;
  previousShipDate?: Date;    // Track ship date changes
  newShipDate?: Date;         // New ship date
  changeReason?: string;      // Reason for change
}
```

**Order Interface:** Current order includes both original and current ship dates [Source: architecture/data-models.md#L105]
```typescript
interface Order {
  id: string;
  orderNumber: string;
  organizationId: string;
  currentStage: OrderStage;
  originalShipDate: Date;     // Initial promised delivery
  currentShipDate: Date;      // Latest revised delivery
  totalAmount: number;
  status: 'Active' | 'Completed' | 'Cancelled';
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

**Ship Date Change Reasons:** Based on Epic requirements [Source: epic-2-order-management-progress-tracking.md#L45]
- Material delay
- Design revision  
- Production scheduling
- Quality control issue
- Client request
- Weather/shipping delay

### Component Architecture
**Component Organization:** Place ship date components alongside timeline components [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#L18]
- Location: `apps/web/src/components/timeline/ShipDateDisplay.tsx`
- Follow existing component patterns from OrderTimeline

**Component Props Pattern:** Follow established prop interface pattern [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#L30]
```typescript
interface ShipDateDisplayProps {
  orderId: string;
  originalShipDate: Date;
  currentShipDate: Date;
  changeHistory: StageHistory[];
  onHistoryExpand?: () => void;
}
```

**MUI Integration:** Use Material-UI components consistently [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#L9]
- Import Card, Typography, Box from '@mui/material'
- Use MUI theming and responsive breakpoints
- WCAG AA compliance built-in with MUI components

### Visual Design Specifications
**Date Display Layout:** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#L9 - MUI theming]
- **Original Ship Date**: 
  - Label: "Original Ship Date" with `variant="body2"` and `color="text.secondary"`
  - Date: `variant="h6"` with `fontWeight="medium"`
- **Current Ship Date**: 
  - Label: "Current Ship Date" with conditional color based on change status
  - Date: `variant="h6"` with conditional color (success for no change, warning for delay, info for acceleration)

**Change Indicators:** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#L30]
- **No Change**: `theme.palette.success.main` (green) 
- **Delayed**: `theme.palette.warning.main` (orange) with delay icon
- **Accelerated**: `theme.palette.info.main` (blue) with arrow up icon
- **Change History Badge**: Show count of changes with expandable history

**Mobile Layout Specifications:**
- Desktop: Side-by-side layout with 50/50 split
- Mobile: Stacked layout with full width for each date section
- Touch targets: Minimum 44px height for expand buttons
- Typography scales appropriately for mobile screens

### State Management
**Zustand Store Integration:** Access order data from existing store [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#L82]
- Use existing orders state slice
- selectedOrder contains OrderDetail with ship date information
- changeHistory comes from stageHistory filtering for ship date changes

**Date Formatting:** Use locale-aware formatting [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#L6]
- Use Intl.DateTimeFormat for user locale
- Format: "Mar 15, 2024" style for consistency with existing UI

### File Locations
**Component Files:** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#L18]
- Main component: `apps/web/src/components/timeline/ShipDateDisplay.tsx`
- Optional sub-components: `apps/web/src/components/timeline/ShipDateHistory.tsx`

**Test Files:** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#L19]
- Test location: `apps/web/tests/components/ShipDateDisplay.test.tsx`
- Follow existing test patterns from OrderTimeline tests

**Integration Location:** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#L21]
- Import into: `apps/web/src/pages/OrderDetail/OrderDetail.tsx`
- Add to existing order workspace layout alongside OrderTimeline

### Technical Constraints
**TypeScript Compliance:** All components must have full TypeScript interfaces [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#L7]
- Type-safe frontend development required
- No runtime type errors allowed

**JSDoc Documentation Required:** All public functions and interfaces [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#L6]
- Include @param, @returns, @example tags
- Component documentation with usage examples

### Notification Integration
**Automatic Notifications:** When ship dates are updated (AC: 4) [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md - Event-Driven Notifications]

**Implementation Scope for This Story**: 
- **Frontend responsibility**: Display updated ship date information when data changes in the Zustand store
- **Backend responsibility (out of scope)**: Ship date change events, Service Bus publishing, and email/SMS delivery are handled by existing backend systems
- **Data flow**: Backend updates → Zustand store refresh → Component re-renders with new ship date data
- **No additional notification handling required** - Component will automatically reflect ship date changes when order data is refreshed from the backend

### Testing
**Component Testing Requirements:** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#L19]
- Test file location: `apps/web/tests/components/ShipDateDisplay.test.tsx`
- Use Jest + React Testing Library
- Test original vs current ship date display
- Test visual indicators for different change scenarios
- Test change history expansion and data display
- Test mobile responsive behavior
- Test date formatting and locale handling
- Follow existing test patterns from OrderTimeline.test.tsx

**Testing Framework:** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#L18]
- Jest + React Testing Library for component testing
- Include accessibility testing capabilities

### Project Structure Notes
No conflicts identified between story requirements and project structure. Ship date components align with defined folder structure and existing OrderDetail workspace architecture. Component will integrate seamlessly with existing timeline components and order workspace layout.
