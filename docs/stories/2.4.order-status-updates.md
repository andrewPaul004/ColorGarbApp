## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Stories 2.1-2.3 established the client-side order viewing experience with OrderTimeline, ShipDateDisplay, and OrderDetail workspace patterns. Story 2.4 introduces the staff-side administrative interface using similar component patterns but with editing capabilities and cross-organization access.

### Data Models and Types
**Order Management:** Leverage existing Order and OrderStageHistory models [Source: architecture/data-models.md#L105]
```typescript
interface Order {
  id: string;
  orderNumber: string;
  organizationId: string;
  description: string;
  currentStage: OrderStage;
  originalShipDate: Date;
  currentShipDate: Date;
  totalAmount: number;
  status: 'Active' | 'Completed' | 'Cancelled';
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

**Stage History Tracking:** Use OrderStageHistory for audit trail [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#L57]
```typescript
interface StageHistory {
  id: string;
  orderId: string;
  stage: OrderStage;
  enteredAt: Date;
  updatedBy: string;
  notes?: string;
  previousShipDate?: Date;
  newShipDate?: Date;
  changeReason?: string;
}
```

**Admin-Specific Models:** New types needed for admin operations
```typescript
interface AdminOrderUpdate {
  orderId: string;
  stage: OrderStage;
  shipDate?: Date;
  reason: string;
  staffMemberId: string;
}

interface BulkUpdateRequest {
  orderIds: string[];
  updates: AdminOrderUpdate[];
}

interface AdminOrdersFilter {
  organizationId?: string;
  status?: string;
  stage?: OrderStage;
  page: number;
  pageSize: number;
}
```

### API Specifications
**Admin Orders Endpoint:** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#L97]
```typescript
// GET /api/admin/orders - ColorGarb staff only
interface AdminOrdersResponse {
  orders: Order[];
  totalCount: number;
  page: number;
  pageSize: number;
  organizations: Organization[];
}

// PATCH /api/orders/{orderId} - Enhanced for admin use
interface UpdateOrderStageRequest {
  stage: OrderStage;
  shipDate?: string;
  reason: string;
}

// POST /api/admin/orders/bulk-update - New endpoint
interface BulkUpdateResponse {
  successful: string[];
  failed: { orderId: string; error: string; }[];
}
```

### Component Architecture
**Admin Page Organization:** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#L19]
- Location: `apps/web/src/pages/Admin/AdminDashboard.tsx`
- Follow existing page patterns from OrderDetail
- Use Material-UI layout components for consistency

**Admin Component Structure:** New admin components directory
- Location: `apps/web/src/components/admin/`
- OrdersList.tsx - Main orders table with filtering
- OrderStatusUpdate.tsx - Individual order update form
- BulkUpdateModal.tsx - Bulk operations interface
- OrganizationFilter.tsx - Client organization dropdown

**Role-Based Access:** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#L227]
```typescript
// Protected admin routes
<Route path="/admin/*" element={
  <ProtectedRoute requiredRole="ColorGarbStaff">
    <AdminRoutes />
  </ProtectedRoute>
} />
```

### Backend Implementation
**Controller Extensions:** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#L106]
```csharp
[HttpGet("admin/orders")]
[Authorize(Roles = "ColorGarbStaff")]
public async Task<ActionResult<AdminOrdersResponse>> GetAllOrders(
    [FromQuery] string? organizationId = null,
    [FromQuery] string? status = null,
    [FromQuery] string? stage = null,
    [FromQuery] int page = 1,
    [FromQuery] int pageSize = 50)
{
    // Implementation with organization filtering
}

[HttpPost("admin/orders/bulk-update")]
[Authorize(Roles = "ColorGarbStaff")]
public async Task<ActionResult<BulkUpdateResponse>> BulkUpdateOrders(
    [FromBody] BulkUpdateRequest request)
{
    // Bulk update implementation with validation
}
```

**Organization Isolation Override:** ColorGarbStaff role bypasses row-level security [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#L184]
```sql
CREATE SECURITY POLICY OrganizationIsolation_Orders ON Orders
    ADD FILTER PREDICATE (
        OrganizationId = CAST(SESSION_CONTEXT(N'OrganizationId') AS UNIQUEIDENTIFIER)
        OR CAST(SESSION_CONTEXT(N'Role') AS NVARCHAR(50)) = 'ColorGarbStaff'
    );
```

### State Management
**Admin Store Slice:** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#L82]
```typescript
interface AdminState {
  orders: Order[];
  organizations: Organization[];
  filters: AdminOrdersFilter;
  selectedOrders: string[];
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  fetchAllOrders: () => Promise<void>;
  updateOrderStage: (orderId: string, updates: AdminOrderUpdate) => Promise<void>;
  bulkUpdateOrders: (updates: BulkUpdateRequest) => Promise<void>;
}
```

### Stage Progression Validation
**Valid Stage Transitions:** Enforce sequential progression [Source: architecture/data-models.md#L119]
- DesignProposal → ProofApproval → Measurements → ProductionPlanning
- ProductionPlanning → Cutting → Sewing → QualityControl → Finishing
- Finishing → FinalInspection → Packaging → ShippingPreparation → ShipOrder → Delivery
- Allow backward progression for corrections
- Prevent skipping stages without approval

### Notification Integration
**Automatic Notifications:** [Source: architecture/components.md#L33]
- Backend triggers notification events when stage changes
- Use existing NotificationService integration
- Email notifications sent to organization primary contacts
- SMS notifications for urgent stage changes (Quality issues, delays)

### File Locations
