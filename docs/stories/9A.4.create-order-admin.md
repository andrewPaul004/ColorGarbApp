# Story 9A.4: Create New Order - ColorGarb Admin

**Status:** Ready for Review  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Sprint:** Sprint 2 (Immediate)  
**Story Type:** Core Business Feature  
**Related Epic:** Epic 9A - Critical Business Features

## Story

As a **ColorGarb admin**,  
I want **enhanced order creation capabilities with full administrative controls**,  
so that **I can efficiently manage orders for any organization with complete customization options**.

## Business Context

**Problem:** ColorGarb admin staff need more powerful order creation capabilities than Director/Finance users, including the ability to create orders for any organization and manage advanced settings like custom pricing, stage selection, and invoice import functionality.

**Impact:**
- Admin staff can create orders on behalf of any organization  
- Streamlined order setup process with advanced controls
- Invoice import capability reduces manual data entry
- Custom stage selection allows orders to start at appropriate manufacturing stages
- Enhanced audit trail for cross-organization order management

**Business Value:**
- Enables admin staff to handle complex order setups efficiently
- Reduces manual data entry through invoice import automation
- Provides flexibility to start orders at appropriate stages based on client progress
- Maintains complete audit trail for compliance and tracking
- Supports bulk order creation workflows for efficiency

## Acceptance Criteria

   - Organization assignment tracked in audit log
   - Invoice import events logged with file details
   - Stage selection rationale captured in initial history

### User Experience Requirements

9. **Form Usability**
   - Step-by-step wizard for complex order setup
   - Organization search with typeahead functionality
   - Invoice drag-and-drop upload area
   - Real-time validation with admin-specific guidance
   - Preview of order details before final submission

10. **Bulk Operations**

## Technical Investigation Required

### Backend Development
- [ ] Design AdminCreateOrderRequest DTO with enhanced fields
- [ ] Implement POST /api/orders/admin endpoint with organization selection
- [ ] Add PDF processing service for invoice import
- [ ] Implement file storage for uploaded invoices
- [ ] Add organization lookup and validation logic

### Frontend Development
- [ ] Create AdminCreateOrderDialog with organization dropdown
- [ ] Implement PDF upload component with drag-and-drop
- [ ] Add manufacturing stage selection dropdown
- [ ] Create order preview and confirmation screens
- [ ] Integrate with admin interface navigation

### Integration Points
- [ ] File storage service for invoice documents
- [ ] PDF text extraction service (OCR capability)
- [ ] Organization management service integration
- [ ] Enhanced notification system for admin-created orders

## Definition of Done

- [x] Admin create order form accessible from admin dashboard
- [x] Organization selection dropdown with search functionality works
- [x] All enhanced fields (order name, performer count, etc.) validate correctly
- [x] Manufacturing stage selection allows starting at any valid stage
- [ ] Invoice import successfully uploads PDF and extracts amount *(Not implemented in current version)*
- [x] Order creation succeeds with proper audit logging
- [x] Created orders appear in both admin and organization views
- [x] Email notifications sent with admin creation context
- [x] Mobile-responsive design works on admin interface
- [x] Unit and integration tests cover admin order creation
- [ ] Manual testing completed on multiple browsers *(Requires manual verification)*
- [ ] Code review completed and approved *(Pending QA review)*

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Admin order creation API endpoint validation
- [ ] PDF processing and text extraction
- [ ] Organization selection and validation
- [ ] Enhanced form validation logic
- [ ] Stage selection and initialization

### Integration Tests
- [ ] End-to-end admin order creation flow
- [ ] Invoice import and file storage
- [ ] Cross-organization order visibility
- [ ] Admin audit trail logging
- [ ] Email notification with admin context

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **Happy Path - Standard Creation**
   - [ ] Admin creates order for Organization A with all fields
   - [ ] Order appears in both admin and org A user views
   - [ ] Proper notifications sent to org A users

2. **Invoice Import Flow**
   - [ ] Admin uploads invoice PDF during creation
   - [ ] Amount and name extracted correctly
   - [ ] Invoice stored in order documents
   - [ ] "Import Invoice" changes to "Edit Invoice"

3. **Advanced Scenarios**
   - [ ] Create order starting at "Production Planning" stage
   - [ ] Bulk create multiple orders for same organization
   - [ ] Handle organizations with no active users
   - [ ] Test with various invoice formats and error scenarios

## Success Metrics

- Admin order creation completion rate >98%
- Invoice import success rate >85% for standard formats
- Average order creation time <5 minutes (vs 15+ minutes manual process)
- Zero data integrity issues in cross-organization orders
- Admin user satisfaction with enhanced controls >95%

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk:** Invoice import fails to extract correct amounts
**Mitigation:** Manual override capability, support for common formats, clear error messages

**Risk:** Admin creates orders for wrong organization
**Mitigation:** Confirmation dialog, organization display with context, audit logging

**Risk:** Complex form overwhelms users
**Mitigation:** Progressive disclosure, step-by-step wizard, save draft capability

## Dependencies

- Existing Order and Organization models (minimal changes)
- PDF processing library (e.g., PDFium, iText)
- File storage service (existing infrastructure)
- Admin interface framework (existing)

## Follow-up Stories

- Invoice text extraction improvements with AI/OCR
- Template system for common order types
- Bulk order creation wizard
- Advanced reporting for admin-created orders
- Integration with external design approval workflows

## Acceptance Validation

**Test Scenario:** Admin user creates order for specific organization with invoice import
**Expected Result:** Order created successfully with extracted amount, proper organization assignment, invoice stored, notifications sent to org users

**Test Environment:** 
- Admin user logged in with ColorGarbStaff role
- Multiple test organizations available
- Sample invoice PDF files for testing
- Email notification system active

**Success Criteria:**
- Order creation completes within 5 minutes
- All fields save correctly with audit trail
- Invoice PDF uploads and amount extracts successfully
- Organization users receive notification email
- Order appears in both admin and organization views
