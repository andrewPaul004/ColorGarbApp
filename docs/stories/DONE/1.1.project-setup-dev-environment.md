## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories exist - this is the first story in the epic.

### Project Structure
Based on `docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md`:
- Use monorepo structure with apps/, packages/, and infrastructure/ directories
- Frontend in apps/web/ with React + TypeScript + Vite
- Backend in apps/api/ with .NET Core Web API
- Shared types in packages/shared/
- Infrastructure templates in infrastructure/

### Tech Stack Requirements
From `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`:
- **Frontend**: React 18.0+, TypeScript 5.0+, Material-UI 5.0+, Tailwind CSS 3.0+, Zustand 4.0+, Vite 4.0+
- **Backend**: .NET Core 7.0+, C# 11.0+, Entity Framework Core
- **Database**: Azure SQL Database with Entity Framework
- **Cache**: Redis 7.0+ for session storage
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library (frontend), xUnit + Moq (backend)
- **CI/CD**: Azure DevOps with Azure App Services deployment

### Development Environment Configuration
From `docs/architecture/development-workflow.md`:
- Prerequisites: Node.js, .NET 7 SDK, Azure CLI, Redis
- Hot reloading for both frontend (Vite HMR) and backend (.NET Core)
- Environment variables for database, Redis, and external service connections

### Database Schema Setup
From `docs/architecture/database-schema.md`:
- Initial entities: Organizations, Users, Orders tables
- Row-level security policies for organization isolation
- Proper indexing for performance

### Authentication Architecture
From `docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md`:
- Azure AD B2C integration for enterprise authentication
- JWT token-based API authentication
- Role-based authorization middleware
- Organization isolation through session context

### Testing Standards
From `docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md`:
- **Frontend Tests**: Located in apps/web/tests/
  - Component tests: apps/web/tests/components/
  - Page tests: apps/web/tests/pages/
  - Hook tests: apps/web/tests/hooks/
  - E2E tests: apps/web/tests/e2e/
- **Backend Tests**: Located in apps/api/tests/
  - Unit tests: apps/api/tests/Unit/
  - Integration tests: apps/api/tests/Integration/
  - Test utilities: apps/api/tests/TestUtilities/
- **Test Frameworks**: Jest + React Testing Library (frontend), xUnit + Moq (backend), Playwright (E2E)
- **Test Organization**: Follow testing pyramid with comprehensive unit tests, focused integration tests, and selective E2E tests

### File Locations and Naming Conventions
From `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`:
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., OrderTimeline.tsx)
- Services: camelCase frontend, PascalCase backend (orderService.ts / OrderService.cs)
- API Routes: kebab-case (/api/order-measurements)
- Database: PascalCase tables and columns
- Environment Variables: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE

### Security Requirements
From `docs/architecture/security-and-performance.md`:
- HTTPS enforcement for all endpoints

- Secure environment variable handling

## Testing

### Testing Standards from Architecture
- **Frontend Testing Framework**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Backend Testing Framework**: xUnit + Moq for .NET Core
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright for cross-browser testing
- **Test File Locations**:
  - Frontend: apps/web/tests/ with subdirectories for components, pages, hooks, e2e
  - Backend: apps/api/tests/ with subdirectories for Unit, Integration, TestUtilities
- **Test Requirements for this Story**:
  - Unit tests for basic API endpoints (health check, auth endpoints)
  - Component tests for basic layout components
