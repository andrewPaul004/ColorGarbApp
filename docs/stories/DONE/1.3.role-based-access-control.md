## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Key learnings from Story 1.2:
- JWT authentication system is fully implemented with secure token generation
- User entity already exists with Role property (Director, Finance, ColorGarbStaff)
- Organization-based data isolation is implemented via row-level security
- Zustand store manages authentication state with user and token
- BCrypt password hashing and account lockout protection are in place

### Data Models
From `docs/architecture/data-models.md`:
- **User Entity**: Already includes Role property with enum: Director, Finance, ColorGarbStaff
  - Role is stored as string enum in database
  - OrganizationId links users to their organization (null for ColorGarb staff)
  - IsActive property controls account status
- **Organization Entity**: Type property (School, BoosterClub, Other) affects default role assignments
- **UserRole Enum**: Three distinct roles with different permission levels
  - Director: Full access to organization's orders and data
  - Finance: Limited access focused on payment and financial operations
  - ColorGarbStaff: Cross-organization access for order management

### API Specifications
From `docs/architecture/api-specification.md`:
- **Authentication Header**: Bearer token contains role claims
- **Role-based Endpoints**: Some endpoints require specific roles (e.g., PATCH /orders requires ColorGarbStaff)
- **Error Responses**: 403 Forbidden for insufficient role permissions
- **JWT Claims**: Include Role and OrganizationId for authorization decisions

### Frontend Architecture Details
From `docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md`:
- **ProtectedRoute Component**: Already supports requiredRole parameter
- **Navigation Structure**: Routes organized by role-specific access levels
  - `/admin/*` routes require ColorGarbStaff role
  - Standard routes require Director or Finance roles
  - Organization-specific data filtering by user's organizationId
- **State Management**: Zustand store contains user role in auth slice
- **Component Organization**: Admin components located in apps/web/src/pages/Admin/

### Backend Authorization Architecture
From `docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md`:
- **Authorization Pattern**: Role-based authorization using [Authorize(Roles = "RoleName")]
- **Claims Structure**: JWT contains Role claim for authorization decisions
- **Organization Isolation**: Row-level security ensures data access control
- **Middleware**: OrganizationIsolationMiddleware sets session context for RLS
- **Custom Authorization**: RequireRoleAttribute and RoleAuthorizationHandler for fine-grained control

### Database Schema Requirements
From `docs/architecture/database-schema.md`:
- **Row-Level Security**: Enabled for organization data isolation
- **Session Context**: sp_set_session_context sets OrganizationId and UserRole
- **Security Policy**: OrganizationAccess policy filters data by organization or ColorGarb staff
- **Audit Tables**: Should track role-based access attempts and changes

### File Locations and Naming Conventions
From `docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md` and `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`:
- **Backend Authorization**: apps/api/src/Controllers/ with [Authorize] attributes
- **Frontend Admin Pages**: apps/web/src/pages/Admin/
- **Role Components**: apps/web/src/components/common/ for reusable role-based components
- **Shared Types**: packages/shared/src/types/user.ts for role enums and interfaces
- **Database Entities**: apps/api/src/Models/Entities/
- **Authorization Handlers**: apps/api/src/Common/Authorization/

### Testing Requirements
From `docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md`:
- **Frontend Tests**: apps/web/tests/
  - Component tests for role-specific UI elements
  - Page tests for admin interfaces and protected routes
  - E2E tests for role-based access workflows
- **Backend Tests**: apps/api/tests/
  - Unit tests for authorization handlers and role validation
  - Integration tests for role-protected API endpoints
  - Security tests for unauthorized access attempts
- **Test Frameworks**: Jest + React Testing Library (frontend), xUnit + Moq (backend), Playwright (E2E)

### Security Requirements
From `docs/architecture/security-and-performance.md`:
- **Role Validation**: All role checks must be server-side, never trust client-side role information
- **Audit Logging**: Track all role-based access attempts and role changes
- **Organization Isolation**: Ensure role-based access doesn't bypass organization data isolation
- **Default Deny**: Implement default deny policy - explicit permissions required for access
- **Role Inheritance**: ColorGarb staff can access all organizations, others limited to their organization

### Tech Stack Requirements
From `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`:
- **Frontend**: React 18.0+, TypeScript 5.0+, Material-UI 5.0+, Zustand 4.0+
- **Backend**: .NET Core 7.0+, C# 11.0+, Entity Framework Core
- **Authorization**: JWT tokens with role claims, ASP.NET Core Authorization
- **Database**: Azure SQL Database with row-level security
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library, xUnit + Moq, Playwright

## Testing

### Testing Standards from Architecture
- **Frontend Testing Framework**: Jest + React Testing Library for role-based components and pages
- **Backend Testing Framework**: xUnit + Moq for .NET Core authorization handlers and controllers
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright for complete role-based access workflows
- **Test File Locations**:
  - Frontend: apps/web/tests/components/common/, apps/web/tests/pages/Admin/
  - Backend: apps/api/tests/Unit/Authorization/, apps/api/tests/Integration/ApiTests/
- **Test Requirements for Role-Based Access Story**:
  - Unit tests for authorization handlers and role validation logic
  - Component tests for role-specific navigation and UI elements
  - Integration tests for role-protected API endpoints with various scenarios
  - E2E tests for complete role-based access workflows across different user types
  - Security tests for unauthorized access attempts and privilege escalation
