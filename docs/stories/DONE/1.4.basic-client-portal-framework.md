## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Key learnings from Story 1.3:
- Role-based authorization infrastructure is fully implemented with JWT claims
- Organization-based data isolation is enabled via row-level security in database
- User authentication state is managed through Zustand store with user and organization data
- ProtectedRoute component supports role-based access control
- Backend authorization uses [Authorize] attributes and custom RequireRoleAttribute

### Data Models
From `docs/architecture/data-models.md`:
- **Order Entity**: Core business entity with organization-based filtering
  - Id: Guid - Unique identifier for API calls
  - OrderNumber: string - Human-readable identifier for display
  - OrganizationId: Guid - Enables organization-based data isolation
  - Description: string - Brief order summary for dashboard display
  - CurrentStage: OrderStage enum - One of 13 manufacturing stages
  - OriginalShipDate/CurrentShipDate: DateTime - Delivery dates for timeline
  - Status: OrderStatus enum - Active, Completed, Cancelled for filtering
- **User Entity**: Authentication and organization linking
  - OrganizationId: Guid - Links user to their organization (null for ColorGarb staff)
  - Role: UserRole enum - Director, Finance, ColorGarbStaff for navigation control
  - FirstName/LastName: string - Profile display information
- **Organization Entity**: Client organization details
