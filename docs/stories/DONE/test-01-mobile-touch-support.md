## Acceptance Criteria
- Mobile browser projects have `hasTouch: true` configured

- All mobile test projects pass successfully

## Technical Requirements
- Update `playwright.config.ts` mobile browser configurations
- Add `hasTouch: true` to mobile-chrome, mobile-safari, and tablet projects

## Files to Update
