# Story 9B.3: Todoist-Style Stage Management - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **ColorGarb admin**,
I want **checkbox-style stage management similar to Todoist**,
so that **I can efficiently track and update order progress with intuitive interactions**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: OrderTimeline component and existing stage management system
- Technology: React/TypeScript with Material-UI, existing OrderStage types and StageHistory interfaces
- Follows pattern: Material-UI checkbox patterns and existing admin dialog interaction patterns
- Touch points: OrderTimeline.tsx component, AdminOperations hook, stage progression business logic

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Order stages displayed as interactive checkboxes instead of current timeline format with radio buttons
2. Click checkbox to mark stage as complete with immediate visual feedback and state update
3. Integration with existing AdminOperations hook for stage updates and notification system

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing stage progression and business logic continues to work unchanged
5. New checkbox interface follows existing Material-UI component patterns and design system
6. Integration with OrderStatusUpdate dialog maintains current admin management behavior

**Quality Requirements:**

7. Change is covered by appropriate tests updating existing OrderTimeline component tests
8. Documentation is updated for new checkbox interaction patterns
9. No regression in existing stage management functionality verified through testing

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria (from Epic 9B)

1. Order stages displayed as interactive checkboxes instead of current timeline format
2. Click checkbox to mark stage as complete with immediate visual feedback and state update
3. Completed stages show checkmark icon with timestamp and admin name who completed it
4. Ability to uncheck completed stages if work needs revision (with confirmation dialog)
5. Stage completion triggers existing notification system for client updates automatically
6. Visual progress indicator showing percentage completion based on completed stages
7. Hover states and informative tooltips for stage descriptions and requirements
8. Keyboard navigation support for accessibility (space to toggle, arrow keys to navigate)
9. Mobile-friendly checkbox sizing (≥44px touch targets) and interaction patterns
10. Full integration with existing stage management business logic and audit trails

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Modify OrderTimeline component to replace radio button icons with Material-UI Checkbox components while preserving all existing props and event handling
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow Material-UI checkbox patterns and existing admin dialog interactions from OrderStatusUpdate component
- **Key Constraints:** Must maintain 44px minimum touch targets for mobile accessibility, preserve existing StageHistory and OrderStage type interfaces

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements met with checkbox interface replacing timeline radio buttons
- [ ] Integration requirements verified with existing AdminOperations and notification system
- [ ] Existing stage management functionality regression tested with no breaking changes
- [ ] Code follows existing Material-UI patterns and TypeScript standards
- [ ] Tests pass (existing OrderTimeline tests updated and new checkbox interaction tests added)
- [ ] Documentation updated for new checkbox interaction patterns

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** User workflow disruption due to interaction pattern change from timeline to checkbox interface
- **Mitigation:** Maintain all existing functionality while only changing visual presentation, provide tooltips and hover states for guidance
- **Rollback:** Simple component revert to previous OrderTimeline implementation via version control

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing OrderStage or StageHistory APIs
- [ ] Database changes not required (using existing stage management backend)
- [ ] UI changes follow existing Material-UI design patterns and accessibility standards
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible (only frontend component UI changes)

## Validation Checklist

**Scope Validation:**

- [ ] Story can be completed in one development session (estimated 3-4 hours for component modification)
- [ ] Integration approach is straightforward (modify existing OrderTimeline component only)
- [ ] Follows existing Material-UI checkbox patterns exactly
- [ ] No design or architecture work required (using established patterns)

**Clarity Check:**

- [ ] Story requirements are unambiguous with clear Epic 9B acceptance criteria
- [ ] Integration points are clearly specified (OrderTimeline component, AdminOperations hook)
- [ ] Success criteria are testable through component testing and user interaction verification
- [ ] Rollback approach is simple (revert component implementation)

## Implementation Notes

**Component Changes Required:**
- Replace CheckCircle, RadioButtonChecked, RadioButtonUnchecked icons with Material-UI Checkbox component
- Update click handlers to support checkbox toggle interactions
- Add confirmation dialog for unchecking completed stages
- Maintain existing stage status logic and visual feedback patterns

**Testing Strategy:**
- Update existing OrderTimeline.test.tsx to test checkbox interactions
- Add tests for checkbox toggle functionality and confirmation dialogs
- Verify keyboard navigation and accessibility compliance
- Test mobile touch target sizing and interaction patterns

**Accessibility Considerations:**
- Ensure checkbox components maintain ≥44px touch targets
- Implement proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- Maintain color contrast standards for completed/pending states
- Support screen reader announcements for stage status changes
