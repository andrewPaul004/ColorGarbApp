# Story Test-03: Create Test Data Management System

**Title**: Implement Automated Test Data Seeding and Management

## User Story
As a Test Engineer, I want a reliable test data management system so that tests have consistent, predictable data to work with across all test runs.

## Priority
**High**

## Effort Estimate
13 story points

## Dependencies
None

## Acceptance Criteria
- Global setup creates required test users and organizations
- Test database is seeded with representative order data
- Test data is isolated between test runs
- Global teardown properly cleans up test data
- Test users have appropriate permissions and roles
- Test data creation is idempotent and reproducible

## Technical Requirements
- Implement `global-setup.ts` for database seeding
- Create test user accounts with proper role assignments
- Generate sample orders in various manufacturing stages
- Implement `global-teardown.ts` for cleanup
- Add test data isolation mechanisms
- Create test data utilities for dynamic data creation
- Update authentication setup to use seeded test users

## Current Issue
Tests fail because they expect users and organizations that don't exist in the test database.

## Test Users to Create
```typescript
const testUsers = {
  director: {
    email: 'director@lincolnhigh.edu',
    password: 'password123',
    name: 'Jane Smith',
    role: 'Director',
    organizationId: 'lincoln-high-marching-band'
  },
  finance: {
    email: 'finance@lincolnhigh.edu',
    password: 'password123',
    name: 'John Finance',
    role: 'Finance',
    organizationId: 'lincoln-high-marching-band'
  },
  staff: {
    email: 'staff@colorgarb.com',
    password: 'password123',
    name: 'ColorGarb Staff',
    role: 'ColorGarbStaff'
  }
};
```

## Test Organizations to Create
```typescript
const testOrganizations = {
  lincolnHigh: {
    id: 'lincoln-high-marching-band',
    name: 'Lincoln High School Marching Band',
    type: 'High School',
    contactEmail: 'band@lincolnhigh.edu',
    contactPhone: '555-0123',
    address: '123 School St, Lincoln, IL 62656'
  }
};
```

## Test Orders to Create
- Orders in various manufacturing stages (DesignProposal through Delivery)
- Different order statuses (Active, Completed, Cancelled)
- Various price points and quantities
- Associated with test organizations

## Files to Create/Update
- `tests/global-setup.ts` - Database seeding logic
- `tests/global-teardown.ts` - Cleanup logic
- `tests/test-data/` - Test data fixtures and utilities
- `tests/auth-states/` - Authentication state files
- `playwright.config.ts` - Reference global setup/teardown

## Database Considerations
- Use test-specific database or isolated test schema
- Ensure test data doesn't interfere with development data
- Implement proper cleanup to prevent data accumulation
- Add test data validation and verification

## Success Criteria
- Tests run with consistent, predictable data
- Authentication tests use valid test users
- Order tests have appropriate sample data
- Test runs are isolated and repeatable
- No manual data setup required

## Story Status
**TODO**
