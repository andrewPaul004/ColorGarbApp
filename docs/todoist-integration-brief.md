# Project Brief: Todoist Integration for ColorGarbApp

## Executive Summary

**ColorGarbApp Todoist Integration** enables seamless synchronization between your Todoist task management and client order tracking system. When you mark order completion milestones in Todoist, clients are automatically notified through the ColorGarbApp interface, eliminating duplicate data entry while maintaining real-time client visibility into their order status and delivery schedules.

## Problem Statement

Your current workflow requires manual coordination between two disconnected systems - Todoist for task management and ColorGarbApp for client communication. This creates several pain points:

- **Duplicate Data Entry**: Order status changes must be manually updated in both systems
- **Client Communication Delays**: Updates in Todoist don't automatically trigger client notifications
- **Synchronization Risk**: Potential for inconsistent information between systems
- **Operational Inefficiency**: Time spent managing two separate systems instead of focusing on order fulfillment

**Impact**: As your business scales, this manual process becomes increasingly time-consuming and error-prone. Clients expect real-time visibility into their orders, but the current disconnected approach creates friction in providing timely updates.

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short**: Generic integration platforms don't understand the specific workflow of order completion tracking and client notification requirements. Custom solutions would require significant development effort without the domain-specific optimizations needed.

**Urgency**: With ColorGarbApp under construction, this is the optimal time to build native integration rather than retrofitting later.

## Proposed Solution

**Core Integration Approach**: Implement real-time bidirectional synchronization between Todoist and ColorGarbApp using Todoist's webhook API. When you complete tasks in Todoist (marking order milestones), the system automatically:

1. Updates corresponding order status in ColorGarbApp
2. Triggers client notifications based on status change type
3. Maintains data consistency between both systems

**Key Differentiators**:
- **Business-Specific Logic**: Unlike generic integration tools, this solution understands your order workflow and client communication needs
- **Real-Time Client Experience**: Clients receive immediate updates without you having to manage multiple systems
- **Todoist-Centric Design**: Preserves your preferred Todoist workflow while extending its capabilities

**Success Factors**: This solution succeeds because it enhances your existing preferred workflow (Todoist) rather than forcing a new system. It eliminates the friction points without disrupting your established task management habits.

**High-Level Vision**: Todoist becomes your unified command center for order management, with ColorGarbApp serving as the client-facing interface that automatically stays synchronized.

- **Scalability**: High order volume might exceed Todoist API rate limits (450 requests per 15 minutes)

### Open Questions
- Should the system support multiple Todoist accounts for team collaboration?
- How should the system handle partial task completion vs. full project completion?
- What level of notification customization do clients actually need?
- Should there be a fallback mechanism if webhooks fail?

### Areas Needing Further Research
- Todoist webhook reliability and best practices for enterprise usage
